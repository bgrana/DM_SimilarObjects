              ancient guidepost here was the so 
called Integral Hodge Conjecture. It has
              turned out that the 
Integral Hodge Conjecture is false in some instances. The
              extent 
of its failure is poorly understood, so the principal investigator
              
and a PhD student are working to clarify this.

To a significant extent,
              the value of basic research in algebraic 
geometry results from the tendency
              of mathematicians to reduce 
problems in various other fields of mathematics
              to problems in 
algebraic geometry. This tendency is due to the ultimate
              
simplicity of algebraic geometry, where remarkably effective 
approaches to
              certain geometric problems have been developed
with minimal reliance on
              infinite processes. While the initial 
translation of a problem from the
              physical world into mathematics 
frequently involves limits, derivatives,
              integrals, and further 
notions involving infinite processes which go well
              beyond ordinary 
calculus, mathematicians have learned to search for hidden
              aspects 
of these problems which are essentially of an algebraic or finite
              
nature.  Neither the task of translating real world phenomena into
              
mathematical problems, the task of discovering a hidden algebraic
core in a
              problem formulated using infinite processes, nor the 
task of solving this
              core problem using algebraic geometry is
often easy. Nonetheless, this lengthy
              process has led to profound 
insights.  For example, algebraic geometry and
              some of the 
algebraic varieties studied by the principal investigator are of
              
great interest to physicists in their current attempts to unify 
quantum
              mechanics with the theory of gravity.
